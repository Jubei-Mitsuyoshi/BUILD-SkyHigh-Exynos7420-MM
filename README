    # GOOD-BYE
    
    To all the XDA Kangers and thieves. Here you go, steal away to your
    hearts content. You never bother with credit and remove previous
    Copyright (c) notices and credits from my previous proprietary work
    anyway. I do have other and older repos with further commit and
    authorship history, but releasing just my latest which had been
    split from the kernel repo for licensing and commit purposes. In
    any case, part of my “development” history can easily be see just
    by “diff” my depreciated ramdisk edits and scripts….. same as those
    thieves do.

    Currently, I do not have the time and patience for once was a hobby
    and will not be continuing past this (unreleased) Android M update.
    As a GIFT, I publicly release my FINAL Android-M adaptation as per
    the above permission notice, Copyright (c) 2017 UpInTheAir. All
    right s reserved. This basically means that anyone wishing to use
    these proprietary scripts, or any part thereof must maintain the
    permission notices, authorship and repo and distributed as GPLv3.
    This applies to open-source projects only, otherwise permission is
    denied.

    Please do not contact me regarding help or bugs that may be present
    or self-induced. You are on your own.

    You will find a list of those thieves at my personal blog “name and
    shame” https://skyhigh478.wordpress.com/2016/12/21/name-and-shame .
    Unlike those POS that have have deliberately removed credits,
    copyright headers and permission notices, I never pretend to be an
    “angel”. This is the end of my hobby, which many many of you fail to
    appreciate and recognise the 10000’s of hours I spent attempting to
    inject a little fun into our devices. It’s not fun any more and just
    lack the interest. You can also thank those POS thieves and
    KennyG123@XDA and his cronies for supporting such actions. They hand
    out “recognised” titles for doing so……….  On the bright side, I have
    a life outside this former hobby, and intend spending that valuable
    time on those deserved of it……… my family :) If you wish for further
    “development”, then kindly request Kenny and those cronies for help.
    Unfortunately for you, judging by their profiles, any meaning full
    contributions to what was a “developers” site will be sadly lacking.
    HaHaHaHa !!!

    A BIG thank you to all that have supported and appreciated my efforts
    to contribute to my many project(s) with an element of originality that
    is not supported by the hierarchy at Kangland. I did try, and did so to
    the best of my limited knowledge and skill. Quite a lot of blind
    building, up to 17x concurrent devices supported !! For some, this just
    wasn’t good enough, and others, an opportunity good enough to steal and
    pass it off as their “original” work . .  . .

    Sayoonara !!
