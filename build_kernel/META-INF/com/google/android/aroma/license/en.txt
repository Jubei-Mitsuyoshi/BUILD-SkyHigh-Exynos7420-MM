<b><#selectbg_g>* BUG Reporting</#></b>

SkyHigh Kernels are optimised for use with STOCK TouchWiz base ROM and without interfering ROM injected 'tweaks'.

I might not have your device variant and or able to reproduce your "issue". With this in mind, please provide as much information as possible, including (but not limited to) full firmware details, steps to reproduce YOUR issue, and what YOU have done to help yourself. Without providing this important information, any potential troubleshooting or logs could be meaningless and a waste of my time.
